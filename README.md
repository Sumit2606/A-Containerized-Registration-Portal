Create main directory as three_tier <br>
Inside three_tier create 3 sub directory as nginx, php, mysql <br>
Put all the files as per directory name <br>
create directory inside mysql named as data and leave it blank <br> (after we are going to bind the data directory as a volume)
Open docker-compose file and check the all paths are correctly written in the file <br> (check the spacing)
Then build the file and hit IP to browser <br>
